# Reconstruction of Bulk Geometry by Deep Learning with AdS/CFT Framework
AdS/CFT correspondence is a powerful mathematical tool, but the dualities are ambiguous in general. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 046019](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.046019) provied a method, using *deep learning*, to find the actual bulk geometry by receiving the experimental data in the field theory. Here, we improve the method in [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.046019), reconstructing a more accurate bulk metric and changing $h(\eta)$ to continuous function.
